            A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of
            actions automatically.[2] A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be
            embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing
            machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.
            <br><br>
            Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in
            Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical
            operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV
            drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike
            appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.
            Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and the autonomous car as
            some of the main drivers.[3]
            <br><br>
            The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[4]
            as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics.
            These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments
            or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots
            are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a
            newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.
            <br><br>
            From the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices
            and even automata resembling humans and other animals, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical
            techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as
            automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control.
            <br><br>
            The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot' was first
            used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti –
            Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true
            inventor.[5][6][7] Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first
            electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer
            Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen.
            <br><br>
            The first modern digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal
            robotics company, Unimation. The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted pieces of
            hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing
            Township, New Jersey.[8]
            <br><br>
            Robots have replaced humans[9] in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do,
            or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer
            space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in
            society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing
            numbers of functions.[10] The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of
            robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in
            the future.
